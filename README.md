# UC_PyEng_Posts

## Short:
A collection of posts about leveraging Python for informal and creative engineering tasks.

## Medium:
A collection of posts about leveraging Python for engineering tasks, this repository offers insights and tools that are more substantial than what you'd typically find in a GitHub gist but not expansive enough to necessitate their own repositories. Included are Python-based solutions, from simple scripts to short library usage tutorials, focused on utilizing Python in more creative ways for engineering.

The name of this collection pays homage to the Universal Century timeline in the Gundam franchise because I am that level of a nerd.
