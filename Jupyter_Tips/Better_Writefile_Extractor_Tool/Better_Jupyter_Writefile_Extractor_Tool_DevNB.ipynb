    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Python programming user of over a decade, I prefer Jupyter Notebooks and believe Jupyter Lab is approaching the big-league IDEs. While PyCharm from JetBrains and VSCode from Microsoft may be the Batman and Superman of the Python IDEs, Jupyter Lab is like the Green Arrow of IDEs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter lab/notebooks have several benefits that make it a superhero IDE, including:\n",
    "*  Successor to ipython notebooks, which itself was built on the ipython interactive IDE. This system has been with the Python community since 2001, predating PyCharm by about nine years.\n",
    "* Allows multiple programming languages via the kernel system, where even Matlab has released an official jupyter kernel.\n",
    "* Integrated markdown, giving users a strong formatted text editor and presenter, allowing near-seamless integration of presentable documentation with code. \n",
    "* Very good markdown integration that is getting better and better with more context-aware editing abilities.\n",
    "* LaTex conversion for not only markdown but tools like Sympy output.\n",
    "* Making PowerPoint-like presentations by duplicating your main development notebook and then tweaking it to make a slide deck.\n",
    "* Automatic indexing and an index browser that makes bouncing around a notebook a breeze when fully utilized.\n",
    "* The notebook itself (though not first/unique: Mathematica, Matlab, R, etc.), which leads back to logging of the development idea and notes along with the code writing.\n",
    "* Your plot outputs, by default in most plotting libraries that are Jupyter aware, put the plot output right there after the cell, so you don't have to rerun the whole code to view a result. Nor manage a slew of pop-up plots while working on plotting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks take full advantage of the Python REPL better than both PyCharm and VSCode. This makes learning new libraries much more interactive than sitting there and just reading the docs, writing code, running code, figuring out why code didn't work, hunting back over a whole code stack for the issue, and repeating. You will be doing that and can, of course, still do that, but it's not the same, and having the REPL in the notebooks makes code fun. By using the notebook cells while writing code, the philosophies of  Fail Foward Fast are pushed into writing code when writing with a scripting language like Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons that I prefer the Jupyter lab environment to code in over the Jupyter Notebook interface for either PyCharm or VSCode is that:\n",
    "1. With PyCharm, the Jupyter Notebook editor is only in the paid version (as of 20240216, and I am not totally against that if the interface was improved [see below])\n",
    "2. Oppsed to PyCharm, There is no considerable project setup to code a simple thing. (VSCode is much better in this regard but still can be a little bit too project-heavy) . Just start up Jupyter Lab in a terminal where I need the notebook to be saved to and/or in a relative path to the data/files I need to import and then just go. \n",
    "3. Working remotely is (check with your local network/IT admin) typically as easy as `jupyter-lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser` to then get the token to the jupyter lab server that is running on a remote computer that I am on the same network. When working on a lab computer in a noisy lab, it is a godsend so that I can work at my desk in a quiet space with lots more monitors and then just bring up the notebook in the lab when I am in there.\n",
    "4. Neither PyCharm nor VSCode have all the features of the Jupyter Lab interface for the notebooks, which I don't get when Jupyter Lab is open source. Neither of them has filters for search by the current cell, and PyCharm does not have anything like \"Run up to selected Cell,\" which is in the Jupyter lab. And while the VSCode Jupyter Notebook system does have that, it lacks the kernel restart alongside it, which can make life fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, there are definitely things about using Jupyter Notebooks that have room for improvement. The code inspection is far less powerful compared to VSCode or Pycharm. Though it job done for me 80% of the time. The debugger is still something left wanting. But the biggest issue I have found that blocks Jupyter Notebooks from being as much of a powerhouse as they should be is getting the code and other parts out of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, there is nbconvert, but it does the whole notebook with no fine-grain control. Then there is the cell magic `%%writefile`, which will write the cell's contents out and not run anything in the notebook. So then, if you want that fine-grain output control that allows writing to any file for each cell, and if you need to run the code in the notebook, you do a lot of find-and-replace. Then, the next thing you know, you end up with `###%%writefile` at the top of some cells and `#%%writefile` in others. So that is what the following tool is for. It will leverage `#%%writefile` with control over what cell content goes into what file while also working with markdown and raw cells."

    "\n",
    "This tool is not a means of abandoning PyCharm, free or paid,  nor ditching VSCode; that simply is not going to happen anytime soon. But `Notebook_Writefile_Extractor` helps elevate the issue of getting content out of a Jupyter (ipython) notebook into other formats (currently preferenced for python .py files) that make it easier to use with said titians (I am avoiding using the word titanic) and in your projects as needed. So enjoy, and if you have any improvement suggestions, work on this work and send me a pull request. "
